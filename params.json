Welcome to the world of Bizz Buzz a game where the only way to win is not to play. The rules are simple starting at 1 and counting all the way to `MAX_INT` (`MAX_LONG` version coming soon) decide if a number is Bizz, Buzz, or BizzBuzz. How do you decide what a number is, well it's simple, by default numbers that are divisible by 3 or that contain a 3 are considered buzz numbers, 4 for bizz, and bizzbuzz for both. Every other number is that number's actual value. So lets get an example shall we:\r\n> 1 <br/>\r\n> 2 <br/>\r\n> buzz <br/>\r\n> bizz <br/>\r\n> 5 <br/>\r\n> buzz <br/>\r\n> 7 <br/>\r\n> bizz <br/>\r\n> buzz <br/>\r\n> 10 <br/>\r\n> 11 <br/>\r\n> bizzbuzz <br/>\r\n> buzz <br/>\r\n> bizz <br/>\r\n\r\nAnd it's that simple.
